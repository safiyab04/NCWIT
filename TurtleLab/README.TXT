Turtle Lab

# Purpose
# 
The goal of this lab for you to experience what your first assignment
	as a software developer at a software company may be like. You
	will be working with a large body of code (Turtle and
	TurtleWorld) with which you are unfamiliar. You don't understand
	all of the intricacies of the existing code base and you aren't
	yet familiar with many of the Java language features that you
	will use. However, through experimentation and browsing the
	documentation, you will be able to complete this assignment and
	most likely go beyond the requirements!

# Requirements
# 
* Open the Unit 1 GitHub assignment which will create your repository
	for this unit (You already did this.)

* Create your class in the TurtleLab project in your objects folder

* Draw a pattern using at least two Turtle objects.

* Invoke multiple methods on the turtle objects to change their
	attributes.

* Follow our[ Java style
	guidelines](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5RGLWvvovYUc09POEhNaXQ3ODg&authuser=0).

* Read the documentation in doc/SimpleTurtle.html

# Extensions
# 
* Make the world larger so that I can print your pattern and maintain
	reasonable resolution

    * World myWorld = new World( width, height );

* Make a more sophisticated pattern.

* Make a pattern that involves multiple colors.

* Change the picture for the turtle to something else.

* Something else? Be creative and share!

* Add more awesome.

# Submission
# 
* Submit a link to your GitHub repository with this assignment.

    * Click on the repository menu in the GitHub App and select "View
    	on GitHub"

    * If the displayed web page says 404 Not Found or another error,
    	copy and paste the URL into Chrome and log into GitHub and
    	the page will then be displayed

    * Copy the URL and paste into the Canvas assignment and submit

* If you would like your Turtle Lab featured on the school TVs, take
	a screenshot of your image and add it to the shared Google slide
	deck based on the provided template slide.
