Cityscape Lab

# Introduction
# 
The goal of this lab is for you to demonstrate that you can define
	classes, create objects, and display graphics via a Java
	application.

# Requirements
# 
* Create a Java graphical application (with a Viewer class, Component
	class, and other classes) that displays a cityscape.

* Design at least three classes for elements of the cityscape (e.g.,
	building, window, sun, moon, car, tree)

    * demonstrate good class design (encapsulation)

    * provide configurability through constructors and instance
    	variables (size, color, etc.)

* Create multiple instances of at least one class with different
	properties and display in the cityscape.

* Animate at least one object in the cityscape. The animation must be
	purposeful, not random. This means that you must modify a
	property of an object and that object must persist across calls
	to the paintComponent method.

* Document all classes using JavaDoc comments as demonstrated in our
	[code
	template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18U-gWhzdb5q6cDMV5up-
	e0itlunQtbrA/view?usp=sharing).

Here is a design class diagram to illustrate the relationship among
	the classes in this project:

# Extensions
# 
* Define additional classes for additional elements of the cityscape.

* Randomize your cityscape (a different cityscape every time)

* Add more awesome.

# Submission
# 
* Submit a link to your GitHub repository for this assignment in
	Canvas.

* If you would like your Cityscape Lab featured on the school TVs,
	take a short screencast of your animated cityscape and add it to
	the [shared Google slide
	deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U-
	ZOuvKdA_kPAs4Fcv0XseUzsy07e3ngDfxTQ_v4d60/edit#slide=id.p) based
	on the provided template slide.
